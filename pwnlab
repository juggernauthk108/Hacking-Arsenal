i had followed the walkthrough and completed this box... pwnlab.. but yet i am going for it again on my own lets see what happens...

test the cookies on the page to which they belong.. i mean if the index.html has lang cookie that is supposedly vulnerable to the LFI
do not passs the cookie to another page as upload..... This is to be done i the intercepted package

SUID set executables, run on owners ID... this can used for privilege escalation 

i do not understand what is EUID ... google is not very clear about it (nor youtube)
I was able to root the box but still exploring and trying to harwiore the steps in my head on many ways to root the box

I'll take my time here
