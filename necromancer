i started the vm. but the scans arent working on any of nmap scans arent showning up anything. I think there is some problem with the adapter settings i suppose.
the problem was not wotht the adapter the vm itself is very sneaky and teda to not respond to the recon pings
GOT TO LEARN NMAP
these are suttle changes to the flags of nmap scan can cause a great change in the speed and the accuracy of the scan of the network.
I have to work on recon.
It is said by all the big players to be the greatest step in hacking. Hope i learn my lessons soon. 
when nothing is being able to be traced go with wireshark and listen to the connnections from the victim machine
