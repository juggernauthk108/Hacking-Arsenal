i have learnt some things about nmap.... first it'll be great to know about the tco hand shake that takes pkacve before the data tranfer begins.. 
It is sa three step handsjak

CLIENT	SERVER
1.Client sends a SYN packet to the server that contains various flags set namely SYN ,FIN , RST, ACk
this also has the seq number say x

2. The server qould acknowledge this packet with SYN/ACK that will contain x+1 and y (its seq number)

3. This will be also acknowlewdged by the client to the saerver by sending the ACK\after which the data transfer can begin..


nmap -sS STEALTH ? SYN SCAN
Nmpa uses this scan to make out whtther the port is open , filteres or closed...
It sends a SYN packet
waits for the SYN/ACK
if it receives the ACK - it says that port is open
if it receives RST - port is filtered ... By IDS that has some condition on that port which means that port is either being filtered for particular ip or service
if no response means the port is closed....


you can alsoa use arp -a to see the hosts that are up
