i had followed the walkthrough and completed this box... pwnlab.. but yet i am going for it again on my own lets see what happens...

test the cookies on the page to which they belong.. i mean if the index.html has lang cookie that is supposedly vulnerable to the LFI
do not passs the cookie to another page as upload..... This is to be done i the intercepted package

SUID set executables, run on owners ID... this can used for privilege escalation 

i do not understand what is EUID ... google is not very clear about it (nor youtube)
I was able to root the box but still exploring and trying to harwiore the steps in my head on many ways to root the box

I'll take my time here... 

i also learnt in this a hack of changing the path of the executalbes:
heres what i tought

find the most used command on the historty: 
history | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -bnr | head

suppose `cat` appears on the top of the list
edit the bashrc file to the malicious script suppose it is in /home/script.sh

export PATH=/home:$PATH

and save the file 

#within the cat
#!/bin/bash
echo this works && /bin/cat $1 #this will print "this works" and also execute the command after it... malicious code can be written here

look for include funtion in the php websites... that denots RFI if the input is not properly sterilizxed

need more understanding of RFI...
